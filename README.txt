genotype_gen.py creates a genotype dataset for a set of individuals, with features to add 
nonlinear interactions between SNPs (dominance and epistasis). Outputs a .raw and .map files

GWAS.py runs a GWAS on the dataset created by genotype_gen.py. Outputs a csv with summary stats, 
manhattan plot of significant SNPs, and a table of the top 10 most significant SNPs by p-value.

RandomForest.py applies the random forest algorithmn to the created dataset to find most significant
SNPs by GINI importance (different than significance in GWAS). Creates a manhattan plot, table of 
top 10 most significance SNPs, and a scree plot to show the proportion of sparse SNPs pruned.

"""How to run
1. Run genotype_gen.py to create dataset (already provided)
2. Run GWAS.py to generate GWAS results
3. Run RandomForest.py to generate rf results

****.raw data file had to be excluded from git submission. This file can be regenerated by running genotype_gen.py
